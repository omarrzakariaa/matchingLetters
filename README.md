The purpose of this laboratory is to interface with the digital I/O pins of the 16/32 Explorer board using C programming language on the PIC32MX795F512L microcontroller. A standalone project was created in MPLAB X IDE where the C programming took place using Starter Kits (PKOB) as the tool used for development and XC32 (v2.10) as the compiler. During this lab, numerous functions and pins were programmed in order to interface with different inputs and outputs, including LEDs, push-buttons, and the LCD display.
